# quantized-containerized-models

![alt text](assets/project_hero_img.png)

**quantized-containerized-models** is a curated set of deployments demonstrating best practices for running optimized AI models in containerized environments. The project aims to highlight how modern techniques such as quantization, containerization and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD)work together to produce fast, lightweight and production-ready model deployments. 

Its core objective is to show that cutting edge, research AI systems can be built without sacrificing reproducibility, scalability or hardware efficiency.

## Replicate as the Deployment Platform of Choice

Replicate is a natural fit for this project because it is purpose-built for deploying models in isolated, reproducible containers. Its infrastructure automatically handles GPU provisioning, CUDA version standardization and  versioning, making it ideal for showcasing optimized, quantized models. 

Replicate’s open-source library [Cog](https://cog.run/) ensures that container images remain consistent across development, testing and production, directly supporting the CI/CD and the testing needs of the project. Also, backed by [Cloudflare's](https://replicate.com/blog/replicate-cloudflare) infrastructure, Replicate offers a stable and performance-oriented platform well-suited for showcasing containerized AI deployments.
