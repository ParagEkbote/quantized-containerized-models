Here's a description of the candy and the animal on it, based on the image:

**The Candy:**

The image shows a hand holding a collection of small, oval-shaped candies. They appear to be a sort of jelly bean or similar confection. There are four candies visible:

*   **Turquoise Candy:** This one has a dark teal/turquoise color and features a detailed image of a turtle.
*   **Orange Candy:** This candy is a bright orange color and has a leaf design printed on it.
*   **Green Candy:** This candy is a vibrant green and also features a leaf design.
*   **Light Green Candy:** This candy is a lighter shade of green and has a leaf design.

**The Animal:**

The animal depicted on the turquoise candy is a **turtle**. It's a fairly detailed illustration, showing the shell, legs, and head of a turtle. 

Would you like me to describe anything else about the image, or perhaps answer a question about it?
