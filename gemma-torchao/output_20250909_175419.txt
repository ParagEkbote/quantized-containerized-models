Okay, let's take a close look at the animal on the candy!

The candy features a stylized depiction of a **turtle**. Here's a breakdown of the details:

*   **Shape:** The turtle is represented as a rounded, oval shape, typical of a turtle's shell.
*   **Details:** It has a small, raised "head" area at the front, suggesting the turtle's head and face. There are two small, raised bumps that could be the turtle's eyes.
*   **Color:** The turtle is colored in a beautiful turquoise blue.
*   **Design:** The design is quite simple and graphic, likely intended to be easily recognizable. 

Do you want me to describe any other details about the image, or perhaps the candies in general?
