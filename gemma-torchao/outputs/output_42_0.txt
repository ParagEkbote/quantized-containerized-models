Okay, let's dive into Transformers! They've become *the* dominant architecture in the world of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here's a breakdown of what they are, how they work, and why they're so impactful:

**1. What are Transformers?**

At their core, Transformers are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data â€“ things that come in an order, like words in a sentence, or notes in a melody.  Before Transformers, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTMs and GRUs were the go-to for sequence
